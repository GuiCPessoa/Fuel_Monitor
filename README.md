# 🍎 Fuel Monitor - Vibe Coding
First experience with vibe coding, I developed this small project to help a friend at work. The project consists of stipulating the fuel consumption of the cars in the yard and knowing the approximate time to refuel the fleet. Below I talk about how I am using the tools.

## 📑 Learning
As I said before, the project consists of determining the fuel consumption of the cars in the yard and knowing the approximate time to refuel the fleet. In general terms, the project is very simple, but at first glance I was impressed with the AI's ability to generate the code. In addition to its integration with Github, this repository was created automatically and any changes made will be sent to the repository. It is a very good tool to increase productivity in smaller projects and even for studies as well. I am currently using Lovable + ChatGPT (creating the requirement document system) with all the system's specifications and business rules. So far, I have not had any problems with Lovable generating something I did not want, the prompt has always been well detailed and documented. In the future I will test more complex projects but keep the engineering prompt. Then I will remember to add the conversation generated by chatGPT.
